# Air Pollution and Mortality Rates: A Data Analysis

## Project Summary

This project is focused on exploring a critical but simple question: Is there a relationship between air pollution levels and mortality rates?

We will be analyzing air pollution data alongside death rates for a specific country and then expanding the scope to compare multiple countries. The goal is to determine whether countries with higher pollution levels experience higher death rates. We might apply machine learning in order to calculate an estimated lifespan for a theoretical country with a theoretical air pollution data.

## What I’m Planning to Do

- Collect Air Pollution Data: Gather historical air quality data (CO2 levels, NO2 levels, etc. might be suitable) from reliable sources such as OurWorldInData.
- Gather Mortality Data: Obtain death rate statistics (overall and disease-specific) for the same locations and timeframes.
- Compare Trends Within a Country: Analyze whether periods of high pollution correlate with increased death rates in a selected country.
- Compare Trends Between Countries: Compare air pollution and mortality rates across different countries to identify patterns.
- Visualize the Results: Create compelling graphs to illustrate trends and correlations.

## Tools and Sources I’ll Be Using (expected)

### For Data
- WHO data (if any are public)
- OurWorldInData (public)

### Python Libraries
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Scikit (expected) for correlation or predictive machine learning

## What I’ll Deliver

- A clean and easy to understand visualization of all the data combined on the subject.
- Insights into how pollution correlates with death rates within and across countries.
